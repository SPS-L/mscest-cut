## Course overview

The aim of this course is to help the graduate students to obtain the basic theory and methodology of CMOS digital integrated circuit design. The course covers the basic theory and design method of CMOS device, logic gate, combinational logic, sequential machine and digital system. The course also introduces the design flow of VLSI from RTL to GDSII.

## What you will learn

- Analyze and design of logic gate, combinational logic, sequential machine and simple digital system
- Analyze and design the structure of complex digital system
- Master the design flow of VLSI from RTL to GDSII
- Experiment the system design or RTL design of a digital chip
