## Course overview

The aim of this course is to foster and promote nano sensor principles and applications and skills/competencies to design a multi-function board-level micro systems using embedded software, hardware design technology, signal detection and processing technology. The course covers the basic theory of micro-nano sensors and the application of sensing technology. It also discusses the micro-nano processing method of the micro-nano sensing system.

## What you will learn

- Analyze modern external signal detection technology
- Identify the role of external signal detection and processing
- Master the physical structure design of signal detection devices
- Evaluate and assess the performance of multi-function board-level micro systems
- establish a systematic understanding of the application of various external physical signal acquisition principles
