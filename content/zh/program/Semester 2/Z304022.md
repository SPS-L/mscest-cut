## Course overview

The aim of this course is to establish a theoretical foundation and gradually master the methodology of analog and mixed IC design for students. The course covers the basic knowledge of analog integrated circuit design and the course design. The first aspect is the basis theory of electric circuit, including the background and development of analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit, CMOS integrated circuit technology and active device, single stage amplifier, differential amplifier, current mirror, active load and voltage reference circuit, output stage, operational amplifier. The other aspect is the course design, including designing and simulating a module of integrated circuit according to circuit requirements
