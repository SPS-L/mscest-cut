## Course overview

The aim of this course is to foster and promote knowledge on various medical imaging methods and skills/competencies in design and analysis of medical imaging solutions. 
This course aims to describe the most important theoretical and practical parameters of the various imaging methods. The course examines the physical principles of the main types of medical imaging such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, X-rays, CT, SPECT, PET, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and electrical impedance tomography (EIT).
The most important knowledge that will be developed through the course is the elaboration and understanding, separation and use of the above concepts. With this knowledge, students will be able to provide solutions to medical imaging problems as well as analyze the data that emerge from them.

## What you will learn

- Differentiate, classify and compare medical imaging such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, X-rays, CT, SPECT, and PET.
- Analyze applications of the above imaging systems.
- Critically distinguish the difference of the above imaging modalities using quantitative comparison factors.
- Identify and recommend important requirements for the approval of medical devices
