## Course overview

The aim of this course is to foster and promote knowledge of microelectronic mechanical systems (MEMs) and skills/competencies in the design and 
performance analysis of typical microelectronic mechanical systems. It also discusses some basic principles, processing technology and design methodology of these systems.

## What you will learn

- Master basic theory of MEMs technology;
- Identify and summarize pros and cons in existing MEMs technology
- Experiment basic processing techniques and design methodology of MEMs
- Evaluate and assess the performance of MEMs
