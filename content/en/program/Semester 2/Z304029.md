## Course overview

The aim of this course is to provide students with a basic understanding of semiconductor device modelling. The course covers the background theory of device modelling, passive and active device model methodology, and device models' application in advanced EDA tools. It also discusses the characterization method of semiconductor devices for modelling.

## What you will learn

 Analyze the compact model structure
 Identify the role of EDA tools in the modelling process
 Collect the semiconductor characteristics with measurement techniques
 Construct a model with the model description language of Verilog-A
 Construct a model for passive and active device modelling with modern EDA tools
 Evaluate and assess the performance of proposed models
