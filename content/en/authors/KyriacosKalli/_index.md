Kyriacos Kalli is a Professor at the Cyprus University of Technology and a former department chairperson and member of the university's Governance Council. He received the B.Sc. (Hons) in Theoretical Physics (1988) and Ph.D. in Physics (1992) from the University of Kent, UK, where he studied linear and non-linear phenomena in optical fibres. He has 280 journal and conference publications, is co-author of “Fiber Bragg Gratings: Fundamentals and Applications in Telecommunications and Sensing”, and has several book contributions. He is a member of the IOP (C.Phys.), IEEE and a senior member of the OSA. His research interests are in optical fibre lasers and sensors, femtosecond laser micro-fabrication of photonic devices and plasmonics; Prof. Kalli was a 2012 Photonics Europe Plenary Speaker and has given 20 invited presentations at prestigious events, such as SPIE Photonics Europe, IEEE colloquia, CLEO (Pacific Rim), ECOC and others, as far afield as China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Canada and Australia. He was the general chair of EWOFS (2019) and WSOF (2017) and has acted as chairman of the SPIE Microstructure and Specialty Optical Fibre Conference for many years. He is currently on the Board of Directors of the Cyprus Organisation for Standardisation.
