## Overview

This master’s thesis, titled **Behavioral Modeling Techniques for RF Devices Based on Physical TCAD Model**, presents a comprehensive study on the development and application of behavioral modeling strategies for radio frequency (RF) devices. The work is situated within the Department of Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Informatics at the Cyprus University of Technology, reflecting the institution’s focus on advancing research in electrical and computer engineering. The thesis is authored by Junwei Ye and supervised by Neophytos Lophitis, with the research completed and submitted in February 2024 in Limassol. The study addresses the growing need for accurate, efficient, and physically informed models that can bridge the gap between detailed device-level simulations and higher-level circuit/system design requirements.

## Key Contributions

- **Integration of Physical and Behavioral Models:** The thesis introduces a methodology that leverages Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) models to inform and enhance behavioral models for RF devices. By grounding behavioral models in physical device characteristics, the approach improves the predictive accuracy and relevance of the models in practical design scenarios.

- **Modeling Techniques for RF Devices:** The work systematically explores various behavioral modeling techniques, evaluating their suitability and performance for different classes of RF devices. The thesis likely discusses parameter extraction, model validation, and the translation of physical effects into compact model forms suitable for circuit simulation environments.

- **Case Studies and Validation:** Through practical case studies, the thesis demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed modeling techniques. These case studies likely involve comparisons between TCAD-based simulations, traditional behavioral models, and the newly developed hybrid models, showcasing improvements in accuracy and computational efficiency.

- **Framework for Future Research:** The thesis sets out a framework that can be extended to other device types and modeling challenges, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and adaptability of the proposed techniques.

## Impact and Relevance

The research presented in this thesis is highly relevant to both academic and industrial communities engaged in RF device design and simulation. By bridging the gap between detailed physical modeling (via TCAD) and practical behavioral modeling, the work enables more accurate and efficient design flows for modern RF systems. This is particularly important as RF devices become more complex and operate at higher frequencies, where traditional modeling approaches may fall short.

The thesis contributes to the ongoing evolution of electronic design automation (EDA) tools and methodologies, supporting the development of next-generation wireless communication, sensing, and signal processing systems. The integration of physical insight into behavioral models not only enhances model fidelity but also accelerates the iterative design process, reducing time-to-market and improving device performance. The methodologies and findings outlined in this work are expected to inform future research and development in the field, fostering innovation in both device modeling and system-level design.
