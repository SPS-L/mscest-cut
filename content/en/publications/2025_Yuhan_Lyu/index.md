## Overview

This master's thesis, authored by Yuhan Lyu at the Cyprus University of Technology, explores the integration of multimodal medical imaging techniques with a specific focus on their application in histotripsy and image fusion. Multimodal imaging refers to the combination of different imaging modalities—such as ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT)—to provide complementary information for diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring. Histotripsy is an emerging non-invasive therapeutic technique that uses focused ultrasound pulses to mechanically disrupt targeted tissues, offering advantages over traditional thermal ablation methods. The thesis addresses the challenges and opportunities in leveraging multiple imaging modalities to enhance the precision, safety, and efficacy of histotripsy-based interventions, as well as the role of image fusion in improving clinical workflows and outcomes.

## Key Contributions

- **Comprehensive Review of Multimodal Imaging**: The thesis provides an in-depth review of the current state of multimodal imaging in medical practice, highlighting the strengths and limitations of individual modalities and the synergistic benefits when used in combination. It discusses how modalities like ultrasound and MRI can be integrated for improved visualization and assessment of histotripsy treatment zones, as supported by recent studies.

- **Application to Histotripsy**: A significant portion of the work is dedicated to the application of multimodal imaging in histotripsy. The author examines how real-time ultrasound guidance, combined with other imaging techniques, enhances the targeting, monitoring, and assessment of histotripsy treatments. This includes the use of image fusion to accurately delineate treatment zones and monitor tissue response, which is crucial for both research and clinical applications.

- **Image Fusion Techniques**: The thesis explores various image fusion methodologies, detailing their implementation and potential to improve the accuracy of treatment delivery. By aligning and integrating data from different sources, image fusion enables clinicians to better visualize anatomical structures and treatment effects, reducing uncertainties and improving patient outcomes.

## Impact and Relevance

The integration of multimodal imaging in histotripsy represents a significant advancement in non-invasive therapeutic technologies. By combining the strengths of different imaging modalities, clinicians can achieve superior precision in targeting and monitoring, minimize collateral damage, and enhance the safety profile of treatments. The research presented in this thesis is particularly relevant given the recent clinical approvals and ongoing trials for histotripsy in treating various solid organ malignancies. The methodologies and insights discussed have the potential to influence future clinical protocols, drive innovation in image-guided therapies, and contribute to the broader adoption of non-thermal, non-invasive treatment options in oncology and beyond. Furthermore, the focus on image fusion addresses a critical need for improved visualization and workflow integration in complex medical procedures, underscoring the thesis's practical and translational significance.
