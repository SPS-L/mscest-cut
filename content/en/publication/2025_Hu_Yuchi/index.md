## Overview

This thesis, authored by Hu Yuchi at the Cyprus University of Technology, investigates the development and application of cardiac health detection sensors utilizing CYTOP-based fiber Bragg grating (FBG) technology. The work is situated at the intersection of optical engineering, biomedical sensing, and materials science, focusing on the unique properties of CYTOP polymer optical fibers and their integration into FBG-based sensor systems. The study addresses the growing demand for non-invasive, highly sensitive, and reliable cardiac monitoring solutions, leveraging the advantages of polymer fiber Bragg gratings over traditional silica-based counterparts.

## Key Contributions

- **Design and Fabrication of CYTOP FBG Sensors:** The thesis details the process of inscribing Bragg gratings into CYTOP polymer optical fibers, highlighting the material's favorable mechanical flexibility, biocompatibility, and sensitivity to physical parameters such as strain and pressure. The work explores the challenges and solutions associated with grating inscription in polymer fibers, which differ significantly from conventional silica fibers due to their lower Young's modulus and different photosensitivity characteristics.

- **Sensor Characterization and Performance Analysis:** Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted to evaluate the response of CYTOP FBG sensors to cardiac-related physiological signals. The thesis presents data on the sensors' sensitivity to strain, pressure, and temperature, with particular emphasis on their application in detecting pulse waves and other cardiac health indicators. The performance of these sensors is benchmarked against existing technologies, demonstrating enhanced sensitivity and flexibility, which are critical for wearable and implantable medical devices.

- **System Integration and Application in Cardiac Monitoring:** The research includes the integration of CYTOP FBG sensors into prototype cardiac monitoring systems. It discusses signal processing techniques for extracting meaningful cardiac health metrics from the sensor data, addressing issues such as noise reduction, temperature compensation, and real-time monitoring. The thesis also explores the potential for multi-parameter sensing, leveraging the multiplexing capabilities of FBG technology to simultaneously monitor various physiological parameters.

## Impact and Relevance

The findings of this thesis have significant implications for the field of biomedical sensing and health monitoring. By demonstrating the feasibility and advantages of CYTOP-based FBG sensors for cardiac health detection, the work paves the way for the development of next-generation wearable and implantable medical devices. These sensors offer improved patient comfort, higher sensitivity, and the potential for continuous, real-time monitoring of vital signs. The research contributes to the broader adoption of polymer optical fiber technologies in healthcare, addressing key challenges in sensor fabrication, integration, and data interpretation. Ultimately, this work supports the advancement of personalized medicine and preventive healthcare by enabling more accurate and accessible cardiac monitoring solutions.
