## Overview

This thesis presents the design and development of an offshore marine environment buoy monitoring platform that leverages LoRa wireless technology for data transmission. The work is situated within the context of increasing demand for real-time, reliable, and cost-effective environmental monitoring in marine settings. Traditional marine monitoring systems often rely on cellular or satellite communications, which can be expensive and limited by coverage, especially in remote offshore locations. By utilizing LoRa (Long Range) wireless technology, the proposed platform aims to overcome these challenges, enabling long-range, low-power, and scalable data collection from marine buoys.

The thesis is authored by Rui Zheng and submitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Informatics at the Cyprus University of Technology. The research addresses the technical requirements and operational constraints of deploying sensor-equipped buoys in harsh marine environments, focusing on robust communication, energy efficiency, and system reliability.

## Key Contributions

- **System Architecture:** The thesis details the architecture of the monitoring platform, which integrates multiple environmental sensors with a LoRa-enabled communication module. This setup allows the buoy to collect data such as water quality, temperature, and other relevant environmental parameters, transmitting them wirelessly over long distances to a central gateway or cloud-based system for analysis.

- **LoRa Wireless Integration:** A significant contribution is the adaptation of LoRa technology for marine applications. The platform demonstrates how LoRa's long-range, low-power capabilities are particularly suited for offshore deployments, where traditional communication networks are unavailable or unreliable. The thesis discusses hardware selection, network topology, and the optimization of data transmission protocols to ensure efficient and reliable operation.

- **Energy Management:** The design incorporates energy-efficient strategies, including low-power electronics and the potential for renewable energy sources (such as solar panels) to extend operational life. This is critical for minimizing maintenance and ensuring continuous data collection in remote locations.

- **Prototyping and Testing:** The research includes the prototyping of the buoy platform and field testing to validate system performance. Results demonstrate the feasibility of using LoRa for real-time, continuous environmental monitoring in marine settings, with reliable data transmission over significant distances and under challenging conditions.

## Impact and Relevance

The thesis makes a substantial contribution to the field of marine environmental monitoring by providing a practical, scalable, and cost-effective solution for offshore data collection. The use of LoRa technology addresses key limitations of existing systems, notably reducing operational costs and extending monitoring coverage to areas previously inaccessible due to communication constraints.

This work is highly relevant for stakeholders in marine research, environmental protection agencies, and maritime industries that require accurate and timely environmental data for decision-making, regulatory compliance, and ecosystem management. The platform's modular design allows for easy adaptation to various monitoring needs, supporting a wide range of sensor types and deployment scenarios.

By demonstrating the viability of LoRa-based marine monitoring, the thesis paves the way for broader adoption of IoT technologies in oceanographic research and environmental stewardship. Its findings can inform future developments in smart buoy networks, real-time data analytics, and integrated marine observation systems, contributing to the advancement of sustainable marine resource management.
