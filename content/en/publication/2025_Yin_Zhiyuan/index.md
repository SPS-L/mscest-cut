## Overview

This master's thesis investigates the development and performance of MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) accelerometers that utilize silicon nanowire arrays as their core sensing elements. The research is situated within the broader context of sensor miniaturization and enhanced sensitivity, which are critical for modern applications in consumer electronics, automotive systems, and industrial monitoring. The work is conducted at the Cyprus University of Technology, under the supervision of Professor Kyriacos Kalli, and represents a comprehensive study into the integration of nanostructured materials with MEMS technology.

## Key Contributions

- The thesis presents a detailed analysis of the design, fabrication, and characterization of MEMS accelerometers based on silicon nanowire arrays. These nanowires serve as the primary transduction mechanism, offering improved mechanical and electrical properties compared to conventional bulk materials.
- It explores the unique advantages of silicon nanowires, such as their high surface-to-volume ratio and tunable electrical characteristics, which contribute to increased sensitivity and lower detection thresholds for acceleration signals.
- The research includes experimental results and simulations that demonstrate the performance enhancements achieved by incorporating nanowire arrays into MEMS accelerometer structures. This includes data on sensitivity, frequency response, and noise characteristics, benchmarked against traditional MEMS accelerometers.
- The thesis also addresses fabrication challenges, proposing solutions for reliable integration of nanowire arrays with standard MEMS processes, ensuring compatibility with existing manufacturing infrastructure.

## Impact and Relevance

The findings of this thesis have significant implications for the future of sensor technology. By leveraging silicon nanowire arrays, the research contributes to the ongoing trend of miniaturization in MEMS devices, enabling the development of smaller, more sensitive, and energy-efficient accelerometers. These advancements are particularly relevant for emerging applications in wearable devices, IoT (Internet of Things) sensors, and precision instrumentation, where size, power consumption, and sensitivity are paramount.

Moreover, the work provides a foundation for further research into nanostructured materials within MEMS, potentially extending to other types of sensors and transducers. The demonstrated improvements in performance and manufacturability suggest that silicon nanowire-based MEMS accelerometers could become a new standard in high-performance sensing, influencing both academic research and industrial product development.
