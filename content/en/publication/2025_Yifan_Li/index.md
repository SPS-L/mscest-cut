## Overview

This master's thesis, authored by Yifan Li at the Cyprus University of Technology, addresses the development and validation of compact models for two critical semiconductor devices: silicon insulated-gate bipolar transistors (Si IGBTs) and silicon carbide metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (SiC MOSFETs). These devices are widely used in modern power electronic systems due to their efficiency, switching speed, and robustness. The thesis is situated within the Department of Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Informatics, reflecting a strong interdisciplinary approach to advancing power electronics modeling.

## Key Contributions

- **Comprehensive Compact Modeling:** The thesis presents the development of compact, physics-based models for both Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs. These models are designed to accurately capture the electrical behavior of the devices under various operating conditions, enabling more reliable simulation and design of power electronic circuits.

- **Validation and Benchmarking:** The developed models are rigorously validated against experimental data and industry-standard benchmarks. This ensures that the models not only reflect theoretical accuracy but also practical applicability in real-world scenarios.

- **Application in System-Level Simulations:** By integrating the compact models into system-level simulation environments, the thesis demonstrates their effectiveness in predicting the performance of power converters and other power electronic systems. This integration is crucial for engineers aiming to optimize system efficiency, reliability, and cost.

- **Focus on Emerging Technologies:** The inclusion of SiC MOSFETs highlights the thesis's relevance to emerging trends in power electronics, as silicon carbide technology is increasingly adopted for its superior performance in high-voltage, high-frequency applications compared to traditional silicon devices.

## Impact and Relevance

The research presented in this thesis contributes significantly to the field of power electronics by providing robust, validated models that can be used by both academia and industry. Accurate compact models are essential for the rapid prototyping and optimization of power electronic systems, reducing development time and costs. The focus on both Si IGBTs and SiC MOSFETs ensures that the findings are applicable to a wide range of current and next-generation applications, from renewable energy systems to electric vehicles and industrial automation.

Furthermore, the work supports the ongoing transition toward more efficient and reliable power conversion technologies, aligning with global trends in energy sustainability and electrification. By bridging the gap between device-level physics and system-level performance, this thesis lays the groundwork for future innovations in power electronics design and simulation.
