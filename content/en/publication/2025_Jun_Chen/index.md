## Overview

This master's thesis, titled *IoT and blockchain-based human health monitoring system* by Jun Chen, explores the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies with blockchain to develop a secure, efficient, and scalable human health monitoring system. The work is situated within the context of increasing demands for remote health monitoring, especially highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the broader shift toward digital healthcare. The thesis is submitted to the Department of Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Informatics at Cyprus University of Technology, under the supervision of Andreas Andreou.

## Key Contributions

- **System Architecture**: The thesis proposes a novel architecture that leverages IoT devices for real-time health data collection and blockchain technology for secure, tamper-proof storage and sharing of sensitive health information. The system aims to address key challenges in healthcare data management, including privacy, data integrity, and accessibility.

- **Security and Privacy**: By utilizing blockchain's decentralized and immutable ledger, the system ensures that health records are resistant to unauthorized access and tampering. This approach enhances patient trust and meets stringent data protection requirements.

- **Remote Monitoring and Accessibility**: The integration of IoT allows for continuous and remote health monitoring, reducing the need for frequent hospital visits. Patients can update their health status via mobile devices, and healthcare professionals can monitor patient data in real time, facilitating timely interventions and personalized care.

- **Practical Implementation**: The thesis discusses the practical aspects of deploying such a system, including device interoperability, data synchronization, and user interfaces for both patients and healthcare providers. It also addresses potential scalability issues and outlines strategies for system optimization.

## Impact and Relevance

The proposed system has significant implications for the future of healthcare delivery. By combining IoT and blockchain, it offers a robust solution to some of the most pressing challenges in digital health, such as data security, patient privacy, and the need for scalable remote monitoring solutions. The approach is particularly relevant in the post-pandemic era, where minimizing physical contact and enabling remote care have become priorities.

The thesis contributes to the academic discourse by providing a comprehensive framework that can be adapted or extended for various healthcare applications, including chronic disease management, elderly care, and public health monitoring. Its emphasis on security and usability makes it a valuable reference for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in the intersection of emerging technologies and healthcare innovation.
